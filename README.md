# Assessment9: PD&J tackle XGBoost
In this assessment, we took a look at the XGBoost algorithm for machine learning. We tested it using several different datasets, all of which are contained in this repository. The notebooks where we did our work are in their own folder here. Finally, we have included our final presentation as both a PowerPoint and a PDF. Enjoy!
